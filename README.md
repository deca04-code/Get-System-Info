# Get-System-Info
A simple way to get your system/computer information, about os, manufactured, model and more.
It is still in the process of improvement, to implement features about your 
memory (rom and ram) and also about your processors.
The only thing you need to do is put in your terminal: pip install WMI
to install a library with windows-management-information.
